# PressbooksCustomPostTypes
NOTE: this plugin is no longer being maintained or updated. Its initial use case, to permit the use of a custom post type called `glossary` with Pressbooks, was rendered irrelevant upon the creation of [a native Glossary tool](https://pressbooks.com/2018/11/28/whats-new-on-pressbooksedu-glossary-creation-doi-integration-and-more/) in Pressbooks.
A WordPress plugin designed to allow certain Custom Post Types in an installation of Pressbooks. Written for use with the Unizin-hosted instances of Pressbooks.
